# Smart-Robot-Vacuum-Cleaner-with-Obstacle-Avoidance
An Arduino-based smart vacuum cleaner robot that autonomously navigates and cleans floors while avoiding obstacles using ultrasonic sensors.    

# Project Overview
This smart vacuum cleaner robot is a low-cost DIY prototype that autonomously navigates and cleans floor surfaces. It uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect obstacles and adjusts its path in real-time, simulating basic indoor cleaning automation.

# Features
Autonomous movement
Obstacle detection and avoidance
Vacuum motor for cleaning
Compact and lightweight design
Easy to build and beginner-friendly    

# Component                    # Quantity 
Arduino UNO                   1          
Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)   1         
L298N Motor Driver            1         
DC Motors + Wheels            2         
Vacuum Motor                  1         
Battery/Power Supply          1         
Chassis + Castor Wheel        1         
Jumper Wires                  As needed    

# Circuit Diagram-- It is there in pdf(Screenshot). 

# How It Works: 

The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures distance.
If an obstacle is detected within a threshold range, the robot stops and changes direction.
The vacuum motor runs continuously while the robot moves.
The motor driver controls the wheels based on sensor input and programmed logic.    

# Code:  Given in the pdf.    

# Future Improvements: 

Add IR sensors for edge detection (to avoid stairs)
Implement a more efficient cleaning path (e.g., spiral or zigzag)
Add Bluetooth or Wi-Fi control
Add a dustbin level indicator
